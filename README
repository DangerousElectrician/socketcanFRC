Use FRC electrical components with a socketCAN interface.

FRC has some of the cheapest, most capable motor controllers on the market.

CANSessionMux.h defines the functions the official FRC code uses to interact with the can bus interface. The actual functions are implemented in a binary for the roboRIO.
CANSessionMux.cpp implements those functions to use a socketCAN interface.

Currently, only a single CAN bus can be used for all devices using CANSessionMux. This is normally not an issue in most cases.
A function that calculates CAN bus load is also not implemented as socketCAN has a canbusload utility to do that.
