Baud rate of CAN: 1 Mbit/s
Needs some activity on CAN bus to switch to CAN mode
	What kind of activity?
		Any arbitrary data seems to work
A control frame sets all parameters of the talon at once
	10 ms control frame
Request device ID

Figure out the functions in CANSessionMux

	g++ -Wall CANSessionMux.h CANSessionMux.cpp CanTalonSRX.h CanTalonSRX.cpp CtreCanNode.h CtreCanNode.cpp ctre.h test.cpp -std=c++0x

"cout <<" will try to print a uint8 as an ascii character

tentative bytes to send over serial to arduino
1 byte length, 4 byte id, 4 byte period, 1..8 byte data
17 byte total

Talon SRX needs to receive a token to enable output
	heartbeat every 100ms? 
		jaguar does this
		Needs a control frame sent every 100 ms or else output disabled
	2 bytes at beginning of control frame?
		CanTalonSRX has a  _TALON_Control_1_General_10ms_t struct with a space for 2 bytes of token (line 125)
	very little public documentation
		other than source code
	changing the control mode works
		change was reflected in 10ms control frame

Create a motor control node?
	CanTalonSRX has many functions, reimplementing would be time consuming
		actually not so time consuming with the magic of vim
Run in an existing node?
	No need to reimplement functions to work with ROS messages.


Layout
	Start ROS node
	Construct CANTalonSRX
		pass ROS node as parameter
		CANTalonSRX saves node in pointer
	Use normal CANTalonSRX api
	Send ROS messages to a CAN bridge node

ros::spin() blocks

FRC_NetworkCommunication_CANSessionMux_openStreamSession and the rest of the stream functions are required for solicited parameters.
FRC_NetworkCommunication_CANSessionMux_closeStreamSession is used once in the destructor
Stream session caches received messages for a particular arbID for later
There is a single arbID for all recieved parameters. Parameters are differentiated by a ParamEnum field in the received message
_can_h is the handle for the stream session
	there is only one stream open at a time
Data from a stream session are kept in _sigs and are accessed by enum. _sigs is a map

tell can device to remember this many messages from this arbID
ask for cached messages
